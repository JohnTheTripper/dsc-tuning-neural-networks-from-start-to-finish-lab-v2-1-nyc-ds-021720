    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've practiced regularization, initialization, and optimization techniques, its time to synthesize these concepts into a cohesive modeling pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this pipeline, you will not only fit an initial model but also attempt to improve it. Your final model selection will pertain to the test metrics across these models. This will more naturally simulate a problem you might be faced with in practice, and the various modeling decisions you are apt to encounter along the way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our end objective is to achieve a balance between overfitting and underfitting. You've seen the bias variance trade-off, and the role of regularization in order to reduce overfitting on training data and improving generalization to new cases. Common frameworks for such a procedure include train/validate/test methodology when data is plentiful, and K-folds cross-validation for smaller, more limited datasets. In this lab, you'll perform the latter, as the dataset in question is fairly limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply normalization as a preprocessing technique \n",
    "* Implement a K-folds cross validation modeling pipeline for deep learning models \n",
    "* Apply regularization techniques to improve your model's performance "
